# Cool Portfolio (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

A sleek, responsive portfolio site with:
- Animated gradient backdrop & glassmorphism
- Project cards with hover elevation
- Scroll‑reveal animations
- Dark / light theme toggle (saved to localStorage)
- Accessible contact form (front‑end only)

## Quick Start
1. Download & unzip.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click).
3. Replace `Your Name` and text with your details.
4. Put your PDF resume at `assets/YourName_Resume.pdf` (or update the link).
5. Replace images in `assets/images` or use your own screenshots.

## Deploy (free)
- **GitHub Pages**: push repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from main → root.
- **Vercel**: `Import Project` and deploy (zero config for static sites).
- **Netlify**: drag & drop the folder onto the Netlify dashboard.

## Customize
- Colors & theme in `styles.css` (`:root` variables).
